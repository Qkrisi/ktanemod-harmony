  description: 'Harmony is a C# library made by Andreas Pardeike that is able to modify
    existing methods at runtime.


    The library isn''t strongly named, which means all of the mods have to use the
    same version of it.


    To avoid conflicts, only one copy of the library will be loaded (by this mod)
    and all other mods would use that.


    This mod adds a 2nd phase to the game''s mod loader, players will be able to manage
    mods that use Harmony from that.


    Note: Mods subscribed from the Steam Workshop that use Harmony will still show
    up in the 1st phase, but the state there doesn''t matter.
